# CodeAlpha_Iris_Classification
Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning. Task 1 for Data Science Internship at CodeAlpha. Achieved 96.67% accuracy using Logistic Regression.
# CodeAlpha: Iris Flower Classification (Task 1)

##  Project Overview
This project is part of my Data Science internship at **CodeAlpha**. The goal is to classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements.

## Performance
- **Model:** Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy:** 96.67%

## Key Insights from EDA
- **Balanced Dataset:** All three species are equally represented.
- **Top Features:** Petal Length and Petal Width are the most significant predictors.
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

## Repository Structure
- `Iris_Classification.ipynb`: Full Python code with visualizations.
- `Iris.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing.
